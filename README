A simple HTTP 1.1 server that redirects requests to the same URL but with the
HTTPS scheme instead, and drops invalid requests.

To build the server, use GNU make. It will produce an executable in the root
directory.

A systemd service unit file is provided in case you want to run it as a service
with systemd.

The code is split into multiple modules, each with one C header file and one C
implementation file:
- the cli module's job is to parse the command line arguments.
- the conn module holds the state for currently connected clients: the socket
  FD, the data that was sent, etc. When the HTTP request has been fully parsed,
  it can be told to compose and send a response to the client.
- the epoll module implements an event loop that accepts client sockets, reads
  data from them to give it to the conn module and write the response when
  possible.
- the main module contains the main function which is called at the program
  startup.
- the reqparser module is fed a request and parses what we want from it to make
  a response.

The standard C library is not used because it adds bloat to the final
executable.
